# Video-To-Descriptiive-Audio
This project converts movies and videos into descriptive audio for visually impaired individuals using a pipeline of data preprocessing, optimal frame selection with k-means, object detection with deep learning, and expression analysis. The audio is mixed with the original soundtrack for an immersive experience, accessible via Tkinter or web UI.
